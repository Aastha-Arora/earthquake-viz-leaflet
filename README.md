### Dataset
'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' data from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

### Objective
Build tools to visualize the earthquake data set.

### Leaflet Step 1
* A map was created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
* Popups are included to provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* A legend is also displayed to provide context for the map data.


### Leaflet Step 2
Additional data on [tectonicplates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates) is ploted along with the earthquake data 
to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
* A map was created using Map layer controls that consist of three base map layers (Satellite, Grayscale, Outdoors)
and two filter overlays (Tectonic Plates and Earthquake data) that can be turned on and off independently.
